# Project: mixed effects models

Load the politeness_data.csv (source: [http://www.bodowinter.com/resources.html](http://www.bodowinter.com/resources.html))

Main outcome: frequency (Hz) - voice pitch
Main predictors: attitude (polite vs informal); gender 

Other columns: subject; scenario (basically, social interaction context, like asking for a favor)

Very vague instructions: 

- build various models of voice pitch
    - Go from simple to complex
    
- use AIC function to pick which model you think best
